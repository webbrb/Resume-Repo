Feature: Allow users to display products in the database.
  
  The user should be able to display products in the database.
  The program should take a single command-line argument for the database file.
  It should present the root menu as in the previous feature:
  
  1. exit
  2. administrator
  3. user
  
  Option 2 should work exactly as in the previous feature. Option 3 should
  present a valid user with a menu of numbered options as follows:
  
  1. back
  2. create wallet
  3. add product
  4. remove product
  5. display products

  Choosing options 1--4 work as described in the previous feature. Choosing
  option 5 displays a list of all products currently available in the database.
  The products should be numbered and sorted in ascending order by price and,
  within the same price, alphabetically by title (case insensitive). Any
  products that were added by the current user should be prepended with ">>>".
  After displaying the products, the program should return to the user menu.
  For instance, an example of the products displayed is as follows:

  1: >>>  skittles: a half-eaten bag  [1 WoCoin]
  2: chalk: taken from a classroom  [2 WoCoins]
  3: >>>  Zombieland: DVD  [2 WoCoins]
  4: apple: small  [3 WoCoins]
  5: paper: a ream for a printer  [4 WoCoins]
  6: >>>  Risk: board game  [4 WoCoins]
  7: trip to Charlotte: no questions asked  [4 WoCoins]


  Scenario: A nonexistent user wants to display the products.
